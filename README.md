#### A Python based simple 2D game made using Pygame.
Kingmaker is a 1 player game (for now) implemented in Python using Pygame. In this game, a player starts as a pawn and can become the king.In order to achieve this, the player must defeat those of his same class to advance his own class. If he engages a unit of a class higher than his own, he will die (Gameover).
